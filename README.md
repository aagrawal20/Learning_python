# Learning_python
I am trying to learn complete python and all advanced techniques. I will post all small projects I complete in this repository.

## 1. Flappy Bird Clone
This is a clone of the flappy bird game. It is built using pygame library in python. This game includes obstacles and simple up arrow to control the birdy.
